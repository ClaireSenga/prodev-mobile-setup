# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This project was scaffolded using `create-expo-app` with the Expo Router
template.

## Scaffolding steps

1. Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app@latest .
   ```

2. Edit `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` and change the default `Welcome!` text to
   `** First App Created**`.

3. Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command prompts to move the existing `app`, `components`, `hooks`,
`constants` and `scripts` folders into a new **app-example** directory. After it
completes you'll have a minimal **app** directory with just `index.tsx` and
`_layout.tsx` ready for your own code.

### Reset-project output

Running the script prints a list of each directory that is moved, then creates a
new blank `app` folder. The console ends with:

```
âœ… Project reset complete. Next steps:
1. Run `npx expo start` to start a development server.
2. Edit app/index.tsx to edit the main screen.
3. Delete the /app-example directory when you're done referencing it.
```
